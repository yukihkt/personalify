## 🔥 Personalify Overview
* Our prototype design: [Personalify Prototype](https://www.figma.com/file/wq8simGjxfhj4cyeCsuT3v/Personalify-Prototype?node-id=77%3A432)
> Personalify's aim is to provide a one-stop interactive website for Spotify users, primarily targeting young adults aged 18 to 30. The bulk of Spotify's user base is below the age of 35, and at that age, we tend to go through a lot of self-searching when we transition into different phases in our lives. With Personalify, users will embark on a journey of self-discovery with a more personalized experience by integrating music that they listen to. By use of statistical analysis of their Spotify listening patterns, in addition to curated quizzes made to determine their personality, we will be able to determine they strengths and weaknesses, suitable career paths, team dynamics, and match them with personality types that we believe they will work best with.

## ðŸ”¥ Personalify Overview
* Our prototype design: [Personalify Prototype]
> Personalify's aim is to provide a one-stop interactive website for Spotify users, primarily targeting young adults aged 18 to 30. The bulk of Spotify's user base is below the age of 35, and at that age, we tend to go through a lot of self-searching when we transition into different phases in our lives. With Personalify, users will embark on a journey of self-discovery with a more personalized experience by integrating music that they listen to. By use of statistical analysis of their Spotify listening patterns, in addition to curated quizzes made to determine their personality, we will be able to determine they strengths and weaknesses, suitable career paths, team dynamics, and match them with personality types that we believe they will work best with.
<!-- * Describe your project. What is it called? What does it do? Why did you make this web application? Who will benefit from using your web application? Describe your users - who are they? (anyone? or specific target age group or gender? region? country?)
* Feel free to use diagrams and images to describe. For example, if you have a system architecture diagram, please place it here and describe it. If you have a business process diagram, you can also place it here and describe it. -->


## âœ¨ Project Setup: How to Install and Run Our Web Application (for Developers)
* switch into the vue cli directory (assumption: vue cli is installed)
```
cd .\Vue-cli-so-far\
```
* install the required dependencies
```
npm install
```
* Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
npm run serve
```
* Compiles and minifies for production
```
npm run build
```
* Lints and fixes files
```
npm run lint
```
<!-- * If a new developer were to have access to your IS216 project GitHub repo (and subsequently your source code files) and replicate your development environment on his development laptop computer, what are the steps he should take?
* What does he needs to install on his development laptop computer? How can he download your project files and run it on his own computer?
* Provide a step-by-step description of how to get the development environment running. You can choose to do so for at least 1 Operating System (Windows 10 or Mac OS).
* Feel free to use diagrams and images to describe. -->


## ðŸ¤“ [OPTIONAL] How to Deploy Our Web Application (for Developers) ##
* As an optional X-factor, did your group deploy your web application to cloud? (e.g. AWS, GCP, Azure, Heroku, Digital Ocean, or similar) If so, provide a step-by-step description of how a developer can deploy your web application
* Feel free to use diagrams and images to describe.


## ðŸ¤“ How to Use Our Web Application (for Visitors to our Website) ##
> To fully utilize our website, please contact [personName] and provide your spotify email address to be explicitly added into the system, as spotify currently only allows up to 25 explicitly added users into the system. If demand is high enough, we should be able to request for a quota extension to allow all users to access our web application with ease!
<!-- * Yay! Your website is READY for visitors!
* Provide a step-by-step description of what the user/visitor can/should do upon visiting your website for the first time.
* It would be wonderful if you could include **screenshot images** of web pages to demonsrate what the user/visitor can/should do. -->
